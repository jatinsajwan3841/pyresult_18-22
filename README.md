# Wahiyad cheez

This is simply a beginner level thing, extracting all semester results of an individual of batch 2018-22.
Here I've tried to extract data from the excel files and print the output in console and save this output in result.xlsx

#required module 
  openpyxl ,
  better to install using '''pip install openpyxl''' from cmd.
  
run main.py and follow onscreen instructions, text wrap in console can make things worse, using pycharm can solve it. 
Better to open output file result.xlsx created in same directory.
