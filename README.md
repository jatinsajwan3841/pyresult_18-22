This is simply a beginner level thing, extracting all semester results of an individual of batch 2018-22.
Here I've tried to extract data from the excel files and print marks and percentage in console in a tabular format, show your performance in a graph based on percentage obtained in different semesters and save detailed result in result.xlsx file created after running this script. 

# required modules
  openpyxl, 
  matplotlib, 
  prettytable
  
run main.py and follow onscreen instructions.For detailed result open result.xlsx created in same directory.
